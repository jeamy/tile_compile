# Cross-Wavelength Astronomical Reconstruction

## Integration Challenges
- Varying spatial resolutions
- Instrument-specific noise
- Heterogeneous observation characteristics

## Proposed Strategies
1. Multi-Wavelength Registration
   - Adaptive alignment techniques
   - Resolution normalization
   - Consistent feature mapping

2. Adaptive Quality Metrics
   - Instrument-aware weighting
   - Noise profile integration
   - Unified quality assessment

## Implementation Approach
```python
class MultiWavelengthIntegrator:
    def align_observations(self, wavelength_datasets):
        """
        Cross-wavelength reconstruction:
        - Feature-based alignment
        - Adaptive noise handling
        - Consistent quality preservation
        """
        pass
```

## Key Innovation Areas
- Unified observation framework
- Artifact cross-calibration
- Comprehensive astronomical understanding

## Expected Scientific Impact
- Enhanced multi-instrument insights
- Improved data fusion techniques
- Holistic observational perspectives
