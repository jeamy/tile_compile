# Distributed Processing Strategies

## Computational Challenges
- High complexity astronomical data
- Intensive reconstruction algorithms
- Scalability requirements

## Processing Architectures
1. Distributed Tile Reconstruction
   - Parallel computing
   - Cluster and cloud integration
   - Minimal data transfer overhead

2. Heterogeneous Computing
   - CPU/GPU acceleration
   - Adaptive resource allocation
   - Load balancing

## Implementation Concept
```python
class DistributedReconstructionManager:
    def distribute_tasks(self, frames):
        """
        Parallelize reconstruction across:
        - Compute clusters
        - Cloud resources
        - Heterogeneous hardware
        """
        pass
```

## Key Performance Goals
- Horizontal scalability
- Near-linear speedup
- Consistent quality preservation

## Technological Innovations
- Serverless computing
- Dynamic task scheduling
- Fault-tolerant design
