# Semantic Reconstruction Guidance

## Astronomical Domain Integration
- Incorporate astronomical knowledge
- Preserve known structural characteristics
- Artifact detection and mitigation

## Proposed Techniques
1. Catalog-Guided Reconstruction
   - Star catalog alignment
   - Known structure preservation
   - Contextual feature recognition

2. Knowledge-Based Constraint Injection
   - Astronomical domain rules
   - Structural integrity preservation
   - Intelligent artifact handling

## Implementation Concept
```python
class SemanticReconstructionGuide:
    def align_with_catalog(self, reconstruction, astronomical_catalog):
        """
        Semantic reconstruction refinement:
        - Catalog-based feature alignment
        - Structural constraint injection
        - Knowledge-driven optimization
        """
        pass
```

## Research Objectives
- Enhanced structural preservation
- Intelligent artifact mitigation
- Domain knowledge integration
