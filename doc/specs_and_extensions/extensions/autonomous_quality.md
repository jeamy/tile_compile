# Autonomous Quality Assessment Framework

## Assessment Challenges
- Objective reconstruction evaluation
- Dynamic quality threshold adaptation
- Predictive reconstruction success

## Proposed Strategies
1. Self-Evaluating Reconstruction
   - Automated validation metrics
   - Run-time quality monitoring
   - Probabilistic success prediction

2. Adaptive Threshold Management
   - Dynamic metric adjustment
   - Context-aware quality assessment
   - Minimal human intervention

## Implementation Concept
```python
class AutonomousQualityManager:
    def evaluate_reconstruction(self, reconstruction_output):
        """
        Autonomous quality assessment:
        - Comprehensive validation
        - Adaptive threshold adjustment
        - Predictive quality scoring
        """
        pass
```

## Key Innovation Areas
- Intelligent quality metrics
- Self-improving reconstruction
- Reduced subjective intervention
