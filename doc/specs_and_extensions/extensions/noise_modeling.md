# Advanced Noise Modeling Techniques

## Noise Characterization Challenges
- Instrument-specific noise profiles
- Wavelength-dependent variations
- Non-stationary noise characteristics

## Proposed Approaches
1. Wavelet-Based Noise Decomposition
   - Multi-scale noise analysis
   - Adaptive noise suppression
   - Preserving signal integrity

2. Probabilistic Noise Modeling
   - Statistical noise estimation
   - Adaptive filtering strategies
   - Uncertainty quantification

## Implementation Concept
```python
class NoiseModelingEngine:
    def decompose_noise(self, astronomical_data):
        """
        Advanced noise handling:
        - Multi-scale decomposition
        - Adaptive noise filtering
        - Signal preservation
        """
        pass
```

## Research Objectives
- Enhanced signal-to-noise ratio
- Instrument-agnostic noise modeling
- Robust reconstruction techniques
